00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:16.429 align:center
Ebola is one of the deadliest
viruses we know of.

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:20.391 align:center
If left untreated, it kills
about half of those it infects.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.770 align:center
It can spread through pretty much
every fluid your body makes,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.813 align:center
including blood and sweat.

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:31.235 align:center
Even the dead can transmit the disease,
often doing so at their own funerals.

00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:37.950 align:center
On December 26th, 2013, a two-year-old boy
in southern Guinea got sick.

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:40.661 align:center
Just two days later, he died.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.457 align:center
It took local doctors working
with the international community

00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:48.002 align:center
four months to discover
that Ebola was to blame,

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.799 align:center
largely because it had never before been
detected outside of Central Africa.

00:00:53.257 --> 00:00:58.221 align:center
In those four months, Ebola gained
a head start that would prove devastating.

00:00:58.346 --> 00:01:00.973 align:center
The outbreak lasted two years

00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:05.520 align:center
and mushroomed into the largest
Ebola epidemic in recorded history.

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:12.151 align:center
More than 28,000 people contracted
the disease and over 11,000 died.

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:18.032 align:center
In 2013, Guinea had no formal
emergency response system,

00:01:18.032 --> 00:01:21.494 align:center
few trained contact tracers,
and no rapid tests,

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:24.997 align:center
border screenings,
or licensed vaccine for Ebola.

00:01:25.123 --> 00:01:27.250 align:center
After that epidemic, Guinea,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.419 align:center
with the support of the US
and other international partners,

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:34.215 align:center
completely overhauled
their epidemic response system.

00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:40.680 align:center
And in January 2021, that system
faced its first real test.

00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:46.018 align:center
It started when a nurse in southern Guinea
developed a headache, vomiting, and fever.

00:01:46.477 --> 00:01:48.354 align:center
A few days later, she died.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.524 align:center
As dictated by traditional
burial practices,

00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:54.277 align:center
her family prepared her body
for the funeral.

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:57.780 align:center
Within a week, the nurse’s husband
and other family members

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.116 align:center
started experiencing symptoms.

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:06.455 align:center
Health officials suspected Ebola much
quicker than in 2013 and ordered tests.

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:07.874 align:center
They came back positive,

00:02:07.874 --> 00:02:11.752 align:center
and Guinea activated its epidemic
alert system the next day.

00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:15.214 align:center
Then, lots of things
happened very quickly.

00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:18.092 align:center
Guinea’s National Agency
for Health Security

00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:22.346 align:center
activated 38 district-level
emergency operations centers,

00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:24.140 align:center
as well as a national one.

00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:29.270 align:center
Teams of epidemiologists and
contact tracers began the painstaking job

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.773 align:center
of figuring out exactly who was
exposed and when,

00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:38.821 align:center
generating a list of 23 initial contacts
that quickly grew to over 1,100.

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:44.410 align:center
Advanced rapid testing capacity spun
up in the city where the outbreak started.

00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:47.622 align:center
At Guinea’s borders
with Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire,

00:02:47.622 --> 00:02:51.334 align:center
public health workers screened
more than 2 million travelers.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.503 align:center
A large-scale vaccination
campaign was started.

00:02:54.503 --> 00:02:57.965 align:center
And, finally, more than 900
community mobilizers

00:02:57.965 --> 00:02:59.800 align:center
alerted people of the outbreak

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.430 align:center
and suggested alternative burial practices
that were acceptable to the community

00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:07.558 align:center
and reduced the risk of spreading Ebola.

00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:10.478 align:center
Thanks to all these measures,

00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:15.066 align:center
the 2021 outbreak ended
just four months after it began.

00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:19.570 align:center
Only 23 people contracted Ebola;
only 12 died.

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:23.991 align:center
That's less than 1% of the deaths
in the prior outbreak.

00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:29.497 align:center
The 2021 outbreak cost
$100 million to control—

00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:33.084 align:center
which sounds like a lot
but pales in comparison

00:03:33.084 --> 00:03:36.754 align:center
to the global economic cost
of the previous outbreak:

00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:38.965 align:center
$53 billion.

00:03:39.882 --> 00:03:43.552 align:center
So should every country just copy
Guinea’s approach?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.513 align:center
Not exactly.

00:03:45.972 --> 00:03:49.642 align:center
It is always important to respond
to an outbreak quickly,

00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:51.978 align:center
so an early warning system is essential.

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:55.564 align:center
But beyond that, a successful response
can look very different

00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:58.359 align:center
for different diseases
in different countries.

00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:02.571 align:center
For example, Brazil quenched
an outbreak of yellow fever,

00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:04.615 align:center
which is spread by mosquitoes,

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:08.494 align:center
primarily by mounting a massive
vaccination campaign.

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.538 align:center
That strategy worked well for Brazil

00:04:10.538 --> 00:04:14.458 align:center
because it’s one of the major global
producers of the yellow fever vaccine,

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:18.796 align:center
and its population was accustomed
to regular, routine vaccinations.

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:23.259 align:center
But for many diseases, you don't even
need a mass vaccination program.

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:29.807 align:center
In August of 2021, a truck driver tested
positive for cholera in Burkina Faso.

00:04:30.057 --> 00:04:33.060 align:center
Health care workers alerted
the government that same day

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.938 align:center
and contact tracing began immediately.

00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:38.858 align:center
Cholera is caused by a bacterium,

00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:44.947 align:center
so Burkina Faso gave antibiotics to those
exposed or potentially exposed.

00:04:44.947 --> 00:04:48.326 align:center
This extremely fast response
stopped the outbreak

00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:50.786 align:center
just a few weeks after it started.

00:04:51.162 --> 00:04:54.165 align:center
Cholera often rears its head
in West Africa—

00:04:54.165 --> 00:05:01.047 align:center
in 2021, there were over 100,000 cases
and more than 3,700 deaths.

00:05:01.297 --> 00:05:06.344 align:center
Because Burkina Faso was so well prepared,
they had zero deaths that year.

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:07.345 align:center
Zero.

00:05:07.762 --> 00:05:11.015 align:center
In Chiang Mai, Thailand,
health officials piloted

00:05:11.015 --> 00:05:14.769 align:center
a community-owned, community-driven
outbreak alert system

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:16.562 align:center
to monitor animal health—

00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:19.857 align:center
that’s important because some
animal outbreaks have the potential

00:05:19.857 --> 00:05:23.194 align:center
to spill over and become human outbreaks.

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.532 align:center
Villagers used an app to alert health
authorities about outbreaks in animals.

00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:33.704 align:center
Over the course of 16 months,
36 animal outbreaks were identified.

00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:37.124 align:center
For any outbreak response system
to be effective,

00:05:37.124 --> 00:05:42.421 align:center
it needs to be trusted, valued,
and ultimately used by communities.

00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:46.342 align:center
That means reaching people where they are,
in the language they speak,

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:50.971 align:center
and aware of the culture, beliefs,
and practices with which they live.

00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:55.267 align:center
Perhaps most importantly, we can't
expect to do nothing for years

00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:58.813 align:center
and then just swing into action
when an outbreak occurs.

00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:03.984 align:center
One of the best ways to save lives is to
invest in lasting health infrastructure,

00:06:03.984 --> 00:06:07.405 align:center
365 days a year, for everyone,

00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:10.282 align:center
especially the most vulnerable among us.
