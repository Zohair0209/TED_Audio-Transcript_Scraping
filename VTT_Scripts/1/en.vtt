00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:16.220 align:center
As your morning alarm blares,
you mutter to yourself,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.848 align:center
“Why did I set it so early?”

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:21.184 align:center
While brushing your teeth,
you think,

00:00:21.184 --> 00:00:23.770 align:center
“I need a haircut... unless?”

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:27.774 align:center
Rushing out the front door,
you reach for your keys

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:29.817 align:center
and realize they’re not there.

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:34.155 align:center
Frustrated you shout,
“I can’t do anything right!”

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.657 align:center
just in time to notice your neighbor.

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:40.244 align:center
Being caught talking to yourself
can feel embarrassing,

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:45.166 align:center
and some people even stigmatize this
behavior as a sign of mental instability.

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:49.170 align:center
But decades of psychology research show
that talking to yourself

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.589 align:center
is completely normal.

00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:56.552 align:center
In fact, most, if not all, of us engage
in some form of self-talk

00:00:56.552 --> 00:00:58.262 align:center
every single day.

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:01.015 align:center
So why do we talk to ourselves?

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:03.684 align:center
And does what we say matter?

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:07.855 align:center
Self-talk refers to the narration
inside your head,

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:10.024 align:center
sometimes called inner speech.

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.028 align:center
It differs from mental imagery
or recalling facts and figures.

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:17.365 align:center
Specifically, psychologists
define self-talk

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:22.411 align:center
as verbalized thoughts directed toward
yourself or some facet of your life.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.375 align:center
This includes personal conversations like
“I need to work on my free throw.”

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.378 align:center
But it also includes reflections
you have throughout the day,

00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:34.257 align:center
like “The gym is crowded tonight.
I’ll come back tomorrow.”

00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:37.468 align:center
And while most self-talk
in adults tends to be silent,

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:41.305 align:center
speaking to yourself out loud
also falls into this category.

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:46.269 align:center
In fact, psychologists believe our first
experiences with self-talk

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:47.436 align:center
are mostly vocal,

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:51.232 align:center
as children often speak to themselves
out loud as they play.

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:55.736 align:center
In the 1930s, Russian psychologist
Lev Vygotsky hypothesized

00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:58.781 align:center
that this kind of speech was
actually key to development.

00:01:59.198 --> 00:02:01.951 align:center
By repeating conversations
they’ve had with adults,

00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:06.247 align:center
children practice managing their behaviors
and emotions on their own.

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:12.378 align:center
Then, as they grow older, this outward
self-talk tends to become internalized,

00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:15.214 align:center
morphing into a private inner dialogue.

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.092 align:center
We know this internal self-talk
is important,

00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:20.928 align:center
and can help you plan,
work through difficult situations,

00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:23.014 align:center
and even motivate you throughout the day.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.350 align:center
But studying self-talk can be difficult.

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:31.647 align:center
It relies on study subjects clearly
tracking a behavior that’s spontaneous

00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:33.816 align:center
and often done without conscious control.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.778 align:center
For this reason, scientists are still
working to answer basic questions,

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:40.823 align:center
like, why do some people
self-talk more than others?

00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:44.619 align:center
What areas of the brain are activated
during self-talk?

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.456 align:center
And how does this activation differ
from normal conversation?

00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:51.250 align:center
One thing we know for certain, however,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.088 align:center
is that what you say in these
conversations can have real impacts

00:02:56.088 --> 00:02:58.633 align:center
on your attitude and performance.

00:02:59.383 --> 00:03:02.845 align:center
Engaging in self-talk
that’s instructional or motivational

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:06.599 align:center
has been shown to increase focus,
boost self-esteem,

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.268 align:center
and help tackle everyday tasks.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.272 align:center
For example, one study
of collegiate tennis players

00:03:13.272 --> 00:03:17.193 align:center
found that incorporating instructional
self-talk into practice

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:20.488 align:center
increased their concentration
and accuracy.

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:24.742 align:center
And just as chatting to a friend
can help decrease stress,

00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:30.373 align:center
speaking directly to yourself may also
help you regulate your emotions.

00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:34.252 align:center
Distanced self-talk is when
you talk to yourself,

00:03:34.252 --> 00:03:36.712 align:center
as if in conversation with another person.

00:03:36.712 --> 00:03:40.174 align:center
So, rather than
“I’m going to crush this exam,”

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:44.720 align:center
you might think,
“Caleb, you are prepared for this test!”

00:03:44.887 --> 00:03:48.808 align:center
One study found that this kind
of self-talk was especially beneficial

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:53.396 align:center
for reducing stress
when engaging in anxiety-inducing tasks,

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:56.148 align:center
such as meeting new people
or public speaking.

00:03:56.524 --> 00:04:01.654 align:center
But where positive self-talk can help you,
negative self-talk can harm you.

00:04:01.988 --> 00:04:05.283 align:center
Most people are critical
of themselves occasionally,

00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:08.995 align:center
but when this behavior gets too frequent
or excessively negative,

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:10.579 align:center
it can become toxic.

00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:14.083 align:center
High levels of negative self-talk
are often predictive

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:16.627 align:center
of anxiety in children and adults.

00:04:16.627 --> 00:04:19.714 align:center
And those who constantly blame themselves
for their problems

00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:21.841 align:center
and ruminate on those situations

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:25.386 align:center
typically experience
more intense feelings of depression.

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:28.889 align:center
Today, there’s a field
of psychological treatment

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.810 align:center
called cognitive behavioral therapy,
or CBT,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.481 align:center
which is partially focused on regulating
the tone of self-talk.

00:04:37.982 --> 00:04:41.235 align:center
Cognitive behavioral therapists
often teach strategies

00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.946 align:center
to identify cycles of negative thoughts

00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:48.200 align:center
and replace them with neutral
or more compassionate reflections.

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.872 align:center
Over time, these tools can improve
one's mental health.

00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:57.001 align:center
So the next time you find yourself
chatting with yourself,

00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:58.961 align:center
remember to be kind.

00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:03.591 align:center
That inner voice is a partner you’ll be
talking to for many years to come.
