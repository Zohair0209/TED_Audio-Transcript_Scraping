00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:16.387 align:center
For almost two millennia,
the Pope has been a figure

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:20.933 align:center
of supreme spiritual authority
for Catholics around the world.

00:00:21.893 --> 00:00:25.396 align:center
But in the late 14th century,
Catholics found themselves

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:29.984 align:center
with not one, not two, but three popes.

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:33.237 align:center
Where did this plethora of popes
come from?

00:00:33.654 --> 00:00:36.699 align:center
And who among them was
the genuine article?

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:42.622 align:center
The origins of this papal predicament
began in 1296,

00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:47.668 align:center
when France’s King Philip IV decided
to raise taxes on the Church.

00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:50.838 align:center
Given the clergy’s political power,

00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:56.719 align:center
this offended Pope Boniface VIII,
leading him to write the “Unam Sanctam”:

00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:02.600 align:center
a radical decree asserting the Pope’s
total supremacy over earthly rulers.

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:05.770 align:center
But King Philip struck back.

00:01:05.978 --> 00:01:11.275 align:center
He declared Boniface a heretic and tried
to have him arrested in a violent raid.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.571 align:center
Boniface survived the assault,
but died soon after.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:22.286 align:center
And following a short-lived successor,
Pope Clement V was elected in 1305.

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:28.960 align:center
A French diplomat seeking peace in the war
between England and his homeland,

00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:32.004 align:center
Clement wanted to stay close
to the conflict

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.090 align:center
and escape the demands of Rome.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.262 align:center
So in 1309, he moved the seat
of the papacy to Avignon—

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.850 align:center
a city close to France but owned
by a vassal of the Church.

00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:48.271 align:center
The papacy remained here
for the terms of seven popes

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:53.526 align:center
until the reigning Pope finally returned
to Italy in 1376.

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:58.406 align:center
But just several months after his arrival,
he suddenly died.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:05.121 align:center
This shocking development meant a new
pope had to be elected immediately—

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:10.960 align:center
and in Rome, where there hadn’t been
a papal election in over 70 years.

00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:14.589 align:center
The Romans were determined
to elect one of their own

00:02:14.922 --> 00:02:19.093 align:center
and restore Rome as the seat
of Western Christendom.

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:24.348 align:center
Local officials pressured cardinals
to choose an Italian pope,

00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:30.021 align:center
while rowdy mobs raided the conclave
and plundered the papal wine cellar.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.777 align:center
Amidst this chaos, the cardinals elected
the Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari

00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:39.488 align:center
to become Pope Urban VI.

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:43.242 align:center
Initially, Urban was seen
as a safe choice.

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:48.915 align:center
But he quickly proved to be a reformer who
sought to limit the cardinal’s finances.

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:52.960 align:center
Desperate to maintain
their luxurious lifestyles,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.464 align:center
the cardinals declared
the recent election illegitimate,

00:02:56.464 --> 00:03:00.468 align:center
since it was decided under pressure
from the Roman mob.

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:04.013 align:center
They denounced Urban as a usurper

00:03:04.013 --> 00:03:08.142 align:center
and held a new conclave
to elect Pope Clement VII.

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:12.813 align:center
Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban,

00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:15.691 align:center
but he refused to recognize
the authority of Clement

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:17.652 align:center
or his greedy cardinals.

00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:23.866 align:center
Urban named new cardinals to his court
and entrenched himself in Rome

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:27.995 align:center
while Clement and his supporters
returned to Avignon.

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.249 align:center
The schism had officially begun.

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:38.547 align:center
Western Christendom now had two capitals,
Avignon and Rome,

00:03:39.048 --> 00:03:42.510 align:center
each with their own Pope
and court of cardinals.

00:03:42.843 --> 00:03:47.932 align:center
As popes from each line died,
their cardinals appointed successors,

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.810 align:center
continuing the crisis for decades.

00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:56.774 align:center
This strange situation didn't impact
most ordinary Catholics,

00:03:56.774 --> 00:04:00.319 align:center
as there were no significant
doctrinal splits.

00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:05.366 align:center
Instead, the drama played
out in the diplomatic realm.

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:09.370 align:center
European rulers were forced
to choose sides,

00:04:09.453 --> 00:04:14.208 align:center
as both popes vied
for spiritual and political supremacy.

00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:19.422 align:center
Only a pope had the authority
to call a general council

00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:21.549 align:center
to officially resolve the issue,

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.885 align:center
and both sides refused to take this step.

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:30.641 align:center
So in 1409, a group of cardinals
from France and Rome

00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:32.852 align:center
took matters into their own hands.

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:36.355 align:center
They claimed that since both
popes were disputed,

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:39.817 align:center
cardinals did have the right
to call a council.

00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:44.947 align:center
And at their gathering these cardinals
deposed the pretenders

00:04:44.947 --> 00:04:46.657 align:center
and elected a new Pope.

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:52.371 align:center
Unfortunately, both Avignon’s Pope
and Rome’s Pope

00:04:52.371 --> 00:04:55.249 align:center
refused to recognize this council.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.755 align:center
So instead of solving the crisis,
the number of popes rose to three.

00:05:01.172 --> 00:05:04.842 align:center
This unusual arrangement
lasted five more years,

00:05:04.842 --> 00:05:08.971 align:center
until the Council of Constance in 1417.

00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:15.811 align:center
Here, the popes from the Roman line
and recently created third line resigned

00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:19.190 align:center
and agreed to unite the church
under a new Pope—

00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:21.609 align:center
Martin V.

00:05:22.276 --> 00:05:28.282 align:center
Undisputed, Martin swiftly excommunicated
the only person still against him—

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:29.825 align:center
the Pope of Avignon—

00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:34.705 align:center
and finally ended the schism
after 39 years.

00:05:39.377 --> 00:05:43.422 align:center
Today, the church’s official records
say the Roman Line

00:05:43.422 --> 00:05:46.133 align:center
was always the true papal power.

00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:49.929 align:center
But regardless of how the schism ended,

00:05:50.012 --> 00:05:54.600 align:center
its existence proves that even those
who are supposed to be pious

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.853 align:center
are prone to petty power struggles.
