00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:18.181 align:center
For thousands of years, native Takhi
horses roamed the steppes of Central Asia.

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:22.226 align:center
But by the late 1960s,
they’d become extinct in the wild—

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:25.354 align:center
the last herds struggling
in meager habitats

00:00:25.354 --> 00:00:28.608 align:center
against hunters and competition
from local livestock.

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.820 align:center
Some small groups of Takhi
survived in European zoos,

00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:35.406 align:center
but their extinction
still seemed inevitable.

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:37.366 align:center
To prevent this terrible fate,

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.870 align:center
a coalition of scientists and zoos
pulled together

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.040 align:center
to start an international
Takhi breeding program.

00:00:44.373 --> 00:00:48.294 align:center
By the 1990s, these collaborators
in Europe and the US

00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:52.298 align:center
began releasing new generations
of Asia’s ancient wild horse

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:54.050 align:center
back into their native habitat.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.096 align:center
This Takhi revival was a world-famous
conservation victory,

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:01.891 align:center
but the full story is much more
complicated than it first appears.

00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:06.771 align:center
And its twists and turns raise serious
questions about the role of zoos

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.065 align:center
and what conservation even means.

00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:12.902 align:center
To get the whole story,
we need to start in the late 1800s

00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:16.322 align:center
when Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky
was gifted

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.908 align:center
the remains of one of these wild horses.

00:01:19.408 --> 00:01:22.787 align:center
Though the Takhi had long been
known to local Mongolians,

00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:25.998 align:center
European scientists were intrigued
by the remains,

00:01:25.998 --> 00:01:30.920 align:center
which looked more like those of a donkey
or zebra than any known domestic horse.

00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:34.549 align:center
They concluded the species was a sort
of missing link

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.385 align:center
between wild asses and modern horses.

00:01:37.552 --> 00:01:41.222 align:center
And as reports of the newly dubbed
Przhevalsky’s horse

00:01:41.222 --> 00:01:43.558 align:center
circulated through Europe and America,

00:01:43.558 --> 00:01:48.437 align:center
zoo proprietors became eager to acquire
the previously unknown species.

00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:54.193 align:center
At this time, zoos were focused primarily
on drawing visitors with exotic animals,

00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:58.364 align:center
and their exhibitions were more concerned
with entertainment than animal welfare.

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:02.952 align:center
But in the early 1900s, the near
extinction of the American bison

00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:06.998 align:center
and the total extinction of other species
like the passenger pigeon

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:10.835 align:center
inspired zoos to rebrand
as centers for conservation.

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:15.798 align:center
And as it became clear that Przhevalsky’s
horse might be headed for a similar fate,

00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:20.261 align:center
zoos began breeding programs to sustain
the captive population.

00:02:20.678 --> 00:02:26.434 align:center
However, the individuals behind these
programs came to an interesting conclusion

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:28.978 align:center
about how the horses should be bred.

00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:33.399 align:center
Like their colleagues, they believed
the species represented a missing link

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.445 align:center
between modern domestic horses
and their more primitive ancestors.

00:02:37.653 --> 00:02:42.408 align:center
They also knew that some of the horses in
their collections weren’t purebred Takhi,

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:45.995 align:center
and many didn’t even resemble
the species’ standard description.

00:02:46.454 --> 00:02:50.791 align:center
So breeders felt it was up to them
to determine what a wild Takhi

00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:52.001 align:center
should look like,

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:53.544 align:center
and breed them accordingly.

00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:57.381 align:center
Basing their work on just a few specimens
and broad beliefs

00:02:57.381 --> 00:02:59.800 align:center
about what a primitive horse
might look like,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.387 align:center
they created a rigorous model
for the ideal Takhi.

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:05.514 align:center
And over the 20th century,

00:03:05.514 --> 00:03:08.476 align:center
breeders in western zoos
and private collections

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:11.437 align:center
created a population
of thousands of horses

00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:15.775 align:center
all carefully bred to share the same
physical characteristics.

00:03:17.818 --> 00:03:19.946 align:center
Of course, in their native habitat,

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:24.825 align:center
wild Takhi had regularly interbred
with domesticated horses for millennia,

00:03:24.825 --> 00:03:28.162 align:center
producing a population with much
more diverse appearances.

00:03:28.537 --> 00:03:32.250 align:center
So when it was time to introduce
the Takhi to their ancestral home,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.502 align:center
they were quite different from the horses

00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:37.421 align:center
who’d been taken from those steppes
a century earlier.

00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:39.465 align:center
Complicating things even further,

00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:42.885 align:center
while these new Takhi herds were
no longer in zoos,

00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:46.389 align:center
to this day, almost all
remain closely monitored

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.766 align:center
and controlled for their own protection.

00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:54.146 align:center
So in a strange way, it’s hard to say
if these animals are actually in the wild

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:56.399 align:center
or even if they’re truly Takhi.

00:03:57.275 --> 00:03:59.819 align:center
The story of the Takhi horse
is not unique.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.238 align:center
In many of our conservation victories,

00:04:02.238 --> 00:04:05.199 align:center
it’s difficult to say exactly
what was saved,

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.161 align:center
and the role that zoos play
in conservation can be very complicated.

00:04:09.328 --> 00:04:13.833 align:center
It's clear that zoos have been and can
continue to be significant forces

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.334 align:center
for animal preservation,

00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:18.921 align:center
especially efforts to save
charismatic animals from extinction.

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:22.717 align:center
But today, the most direct
cause of animal extinctions

00:04:22.717 --> 00:04:26.846 align:center
are humanity’s impacts on animal habitats
and Earth’s climate.

00:04:27.138 --> 00:04:31.892 align:center
So if zoos truly want to help protect the
diversity of animal life on this planet,

00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:34.228 align:center
perhaps they should redirect their efforts

00:04:34.228 --> 00:04:38.607 align:center
to preserving the natural habitats
these animals so desperately need.
