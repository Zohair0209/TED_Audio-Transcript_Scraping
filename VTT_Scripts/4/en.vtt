00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:17.346 align:center
In the 1980s, the world
faced a huge problem:

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:20.558 align:center
there was a rapidly expanding hole
in the ozone layer.

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:23.311 align:center
So, what happened?
And is it still there?

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:25.396 align:center
Let’s go back to the beginning.

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:27.607 align:center
The Sun makes life on Earth possible,

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:32.820 align:center
but too much exposure to its UV radiation
damages plant and animal DNA.

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:38.618 align:center
Thankfully, about 98% of that radiation
is absorbed by ozone molecules

00:00:38.618 --> 00:00:40.286 align:center
dispersed in the stratosphere,

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:44.082 align:center
which are continuously broken apart
and reformed in this process,

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:46.292 align:center
maintaining a delicate equilibrium.

00:00:46.584 --> 00:00:52.423 align:center
But in the early 1970s, two chemists—
Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland—

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:58.179 align:center
demonstrated that widely used chemicals
called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:59.597 align:center
could upset this balance.

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:04.769 align:center
CFCs were developed in the 1920s
by three US-based corporations

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.729 align:center
as coolants for refrigerators.

00:01:07.063 --> 00:01:10.942 align:center
Unlike existing alternatives—
such as ammonia or methyl chloride—

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.112 align:center
CFCs were non-flammable and non-toxic—

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:17.615 align:center
meaning they wouldn't burst into flames
or cause deadly gas leaks.

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:22.245 align:center
They also made great propellants,
foaming agents, and fire-retardants.

00:01:22.662 --> 00:01:26.707 align:center
CFCs soon found their way into a variety
of everyday items

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:29.669 align:center
and became a multi-billion dollar
per year industry.

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:35.049 align:center
In the lower atmosphere, CFCs don’t
break down or react with other molecules.

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:38.386 align:center
But Molina and Rowland showed
that in the stratosphere,

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:41.931 align:center
they're broken apart by UV light,
releasing chlorine atoms.

00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:43.933 align:center
These then react with ozone,

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:46.394 align:center
destroying it faster
than it can be replenished.

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:50.565 align:center
A single chlorine atom can destroy
thousands of ozone molecules

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:54.694 align:center
before finally reacting with something
else and forming a stable molecule.

00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.737 align:center
Seeing the threat to their bottom line,

00:01:56.737 --> 00:02:00.408 align:center
CFC producers pushed back
to discredit the scientists,

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:03.244 align:center
even accusing them of working for the KGB.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.039 align:center
Initial estimates showed
that within 60 years,

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.668 align:center
CFCs could reduce ozone
concentrations by 7%.

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:16.174 align:center
But by 1985, it became clear that ozone
depletion, especially over Antarctica,

00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:17.967 align:center
was happening much faster.

00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:22.763 align:center
Here, the extremely cold temperatures
and unique structure of Antarctic clouds

00:02:22.763 --> 00:02:24.307 align:center
accelerated ozone loss.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.727 align:center
Scientists stationed in Antarctica
noticed a massive drop

00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:30.438 align:center
in overhead ozone occurring every spring.

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:33.941 align:center
Satellite data revealed the vast
extent of these losses

00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:38.946 align:center
and chemical tests confirmed
that the cause was unquestionably CFCs.

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:43.326 align:center
NASA soon released visualizations,
which were broadcast around the world

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:44.911 align:center
and captured public attention.

00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:49.624 align:center
If ozone depletion continued,
rates of skin cancer would skyrocket.

00:02:49.874 --> 00:02:52.835 align:center
Photosynthesis would be impaired,
making plants—

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:54.670 align:center
including rice, wheat, and corn—

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.632 align:center
less productive and more susceptible
to disease.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.801 align:center
Global agricultural production
would plummet,

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:03.346 align:center
and entire ecosystems would collapse.

00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:08.392 align:center
But many politicians— weighing immediate
economic concerns over long-term ones—

00:03:08.392 --> 00:03:10.102 align:center
disagreed about what to do.

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:13.397 align:center
The fight to ban CFCs found
two unlikely allies

00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:17.652 align:center
in US President Ronald Reagan
and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:20.863 align:center
Despite their general opposition
to government regulation,

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:23.616 align:center
Reagan, who had undergone treatment
for skin cancer,

00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:26.035 align:center
and Thatcher,
who was trained as a chemist,

00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:28.496 align:center
recognized the need for immediate action.

00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:33.459 align:center
The US and UK, along with Canada, Norway,
Sweden, and Finland,

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.587 align:center
led calls for an international
ban on CFCs.

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:40.341 align:center
In 1987, representatives signed
the Montreal Protocol,

00:03:40.341 --> 00:03:42.802 align:center
requiring the rapid phasing out of CFCs

00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:45.805 align:center
and creating a fund to assist
Global South countries

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:49.100 align:center
in obtaining affordable,
non-ozone depleting alternatives.

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:52.270 align:center
It was later ratified by every country
on Earth—

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.772 align:center
the only treaty in history
to achieve this.

00:03:55.398 --> 00:04:00.111 align:center
In 1995, Molina, Rowland,
and their Dutch colleague Paul Crutzen,

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:02.863 align:center
were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.241 align:center
As the use of CFCs declined,

00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:07.034 align:center
the ozone hole began shrinking,

00:04:07.034 --> 00:04:10.329 align:center
and is predicted to disappear
entirely by 2070.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.540 align:center
But we’re not out of the woods yet.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.003 align:center
While the ban was a win for the climate,
as CFCs are potent greenhouse gases,

00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:22.216 align:center
the alternatives that replaced them—
hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs— are too.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.844 align:center
While generally less potent than CFCs,

00:04:24.844 --> 00:04:28.097 align:center
HFCs still trap more heat
than carbon dioxide

00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:30.016 align:center
and are contributing to climate change.

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:33.561 align:center
To address this, in 2016,
the Kigali Amendment

00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:35.438 align:center
was added to the Montreal Protocol,

00:04:35.438 --> 00:04:39.942 align:center
calling for an 85% cut
in global HFCs by 2047.

00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:45.614 align:center
This alone could avoid up to 0.5°C of
global warming by the end of the century.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.285 align:center
Today, as we face the existential threat
of climate change,

00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:53.205 align:center
the Montreal Protocol serves as a model
for the decisive global cooperation

00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:54.498 align:center
we need to combat it.

00:04:54.832 --> 00:04:58.252 align:center
The question is, what will it take
for us to come together again?
