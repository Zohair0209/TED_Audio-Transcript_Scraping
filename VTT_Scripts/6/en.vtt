00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:18.562 align:center
Africa is perhaps the continent
that needs least convincing

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.642 align:center
about the clean energy opportunity

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:23.042 align:center
for health, livelihoods and economy.

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:28.082 align:center
As the fastest-growing, yet
least-electrified continent on the globe

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:31.322 align:center
most in need of power systems
that can help fortify

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:33.482 align:center
against the onslaught of climate shocks

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:35.922 align:center
and with both abundant fossil

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:39.042 align:center
and renewable energy
resources to build them,

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.522 align:center
Africa's energy transitions

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:42.922 align:center
and how to dissuade
the use of fossil fuels

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:45.722 align:center
have become an intense
international debate.

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:50.762 align:center
But what the debates often miss
is that Africa is not a single story.

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.242 align:center
As an energy systems modeler,

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:56.042 align:center
I can tell you that though
the baseline is low,

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:57.282 align:center
where they do have power,

00:00:57.322 --> 00:01:01.442 align:center
many Sub-Saharan African countries
already rely on low-carbon resources.

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:03.562 align:center
Kenya, where I live,

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:06.162 align:center
generates 90 percent
of its power from renewables

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.082 align:center
like geothermal and hydropower.

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:10.002 align:center
Even in West Africa,

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.082 align:center
where renewable shares tend to be lower,

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:15.722 align:center
countries like Ghana generate
over a third of their power

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:17.802 align:center
from renewable energy resources.

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:21.522 align:center
And countries like Namibia
are at the forefront of innovation

00:01:21.522 --> 00:01:23.522 align:center
on clean fuels like green hydrogen.

00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:28.682 align:center
Couple all of that with housing
one of the world's largest carbon sinks,

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.242 align:center
the Congo Basin,

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:32.722 align:center
and Sub-Saharan Africa
is consistently recognized

00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:36.522 align:center
as pulling more than its fair share
of the global decarbonization effort.

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:40.202 align:center
So unlike the deep emissions reductions,

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:44.802 align:center
and urgent pivot away from fossil fuels
we need to see from heavy emitters,

00:01:44.802 --> 00:01:46.802 align:center
Sub-Saharan Africa and energy transitions

00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:49.842 align:center
are more a question of how
to quickly ramp up generation

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.842 align:center
and distribution capacities

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:55.522 align:center
in ways that are affordable,
accessible, resilient,

00:01:55.562 --> 00:01:58.522 align:center
while staying the course
of climate compatibility.

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:03.162 align:center
So if the need is urgent
and if the resources are bountiful,

00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:06.842 align:center
then why are we still so far away
from this clean energy future for Africa?

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:12.402 align:center
I've led the design and deployment
of energy projects here myself.

00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:15.562 align:center
And I found and what I've learned

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.002 align:center
is that though the world
loves to remind Africa

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.802 align:center
about its vast clean energy potential,

00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:23.242 align:center
the financial flows
to deliver that potential

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.322 align:center
remain troublingly scarce.

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:32.522 align:center
Projects and businesses incur a number
of hidden compounding costs and premiums.

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:34.602 align:center
Like the risk perception premium.

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:38.162 align:center
Or the “paying back your US dollar loan

00:02:38.162 --> 00:02:41.122 align:center
in a constantly depreciating
local currency” premium.

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:46.602 align:center
Or the “expected to deliver
conventionally high rates of return

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:48.642 align:center
while raising your revenues from customers

00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:51.562 align:center
that earn less than a dollar
a day” premium.

00:02:52.842 --> 00:02:55.762 align:center
So international finance markets
are not appetized

00:02:55.802 --> 00:02:58.002 align:center
and financial flows here remain a trickle

00:02:58.042 --> 00:03:00.122 align:center
despite a pipeline of ready projects.

00:03:00.802 --> 00:03:04.962 align:center
Effectively, this prioritizes
risk to capital

00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:06.682 align:center
over risk to human life.

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:11.082 align:center
In fact, though, 17 percent
of the global population

00:03:11.082 --> 00:03:14.922 align:center
and almost 90 percent of those
still without access to basic energy,

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:19.042 align:center
today, Africa accounts
for a mere two percent

00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:21.162 align:center
of global clean energy finance.

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:27.602 align:center
These realities of local enterprise
rarely make it into the models

00:03:27.602 --> 00:03:29.122 align:center
or the debates,

00:03:29.162 --> 00:03:33.042 align:center
leaving us with a skewed perception
of what transition really takes

00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:35.162 align:center
or why progress might seem so slow.

00:03:36.402 --> 00:03:40.002 align:center
From this perspective,
we can see a key missing ingredient:

00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:43.882 align:center
International cooperation
to deliver the finance flows

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:45.762 align:center
that Africa sorely needs

00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:49.082 align:center
because there’s so much potential
waiting right at the cusp.

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:53.682 align:center
If local enterprise had access
to long-term, low-cost financing,

00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:56.202 align:center
like their counterparts
in other regions of the world

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:57.842 align:center
can simply take for granted,

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.762 align:center
then Africa's clean energy future
would build itself.

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:04.202 align:center
We know this because African communities,

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.522 align:center
by their actions,

00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:07.922 align:center
show us the kinds of futures
that they want.

00:04:09.522 --> 00:04:13.042 align:center
As our cushioned conferences
wax on year after year,

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:16.202 align:center
my friend Jeffrey runs a solar company

00:04:16.242 --> 00:04:19.722 align:center
that targets commercial
and industrial customers,

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:24.882 align:center
helping to kick-start what has become
the fastest growing wave

00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:26.922 align:center
of solar across the continent.

00:04:28.162 --> 00:04:30.602 align:center
And also demonstrating
that African businesses

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:33.002 align:center
see value in being powered by renewables.

00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:38.202 align:center
My neighborhood buddy, Samir,
runs a solar irrigation company.

00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:42.202 align:center
It's estimated that about 95 percent
of farmers in Africa

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:45.722 align:center
still rely entirely
on increasingly erratic rains.

00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:48.882 align:center
So this is a game changer
for food security.

00:04:50.042 --> 00:04:51.722 align:center
My former student, Phoebe,

00:04:51.762 --> 00:04:54.402 align:center
she now designs fuel-efficient cook stoves

00:04:54.442 --> 00:04:56.082 align:center
that reach into thousands of homes

00:04:56.122 --> 00:04:58.122 align:center
from Zambia to Mozambique,

00:04:58.122 --> 00:05:00.242 align:center
providing sustainable alternatives

00:05:00.282 --> 00:05:03.882 align:center
to what is actually the largest
energy use on the continent,

00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:05.322 align:center
household cooking.

00:05:06.322 --> 00:05:08.242 align:center
And at the World Resources Institute,

00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:10.482 align:center
we support dozens of young Rwandan,

00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:13.642 align:center
Ugandan and Kenyan
electric mobility start-ups

00:05:13.642 --> 00:05:17.242 align:center
that are revolutionizing
the face of transit in East Africa.

00:05:18.762 --> 00:05:21.562 align:center
These are real people,
real stories, real families

00:05:21.602 --> 00:05:25.522 align:center
representing a real
wave of local enterprise,

00:05:25.562 --> 00:05:29.482 align:center
successfully serving communities across
an entire spectrum of energy needs.

00:05:30.722 --> 00:05:33.882 align:center
These are real salaries,
real rents, real mortgages,

00:05:33.922 --> 00:05:37.202 align:center
real savings being put
on the line every day.

00:05:38.202 --> 00:05:40.162 align:center
Is that not the utmost confidence

00:05:40.202 --> 00:05:43.082 align:center
in Africa's clean energy
business potential?

00:05:44.842 --> 00:05:47.842 align:center
Imagine how fast we could go
and how far we could move

00:05:47.842 --> 00:05:51.682 align:center
if they had a level playing field
instead of yet more obstacles to climb.

00:05:53.082 --> 00:05:54.922 align:center
And if they can be invested,

00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:59.082 align:center
then what excuse remains for those
with the means and the responsibility?

00:06:01.282 --> 00:06:02.762 align:center
Africa is speaking.

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:05.042 align:center
But it's not one story.

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:07.282 align:center
It's not even 54 stories.

00:06:07.282 --> 00:06:09.562 align:center
It's the stories of thousands
of communities

00:06:09.562 --> 00:06:11.642 align:center
mobilizing the features they want

00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:14.082 align:center
and inviting the world's
partnership in it.

00:06:14.802 --> 00:06:16.002 align:center
Partnership.

00:06:16.682 --> 00:06:20.122 align:center
Not charity, not a victim song,

00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:22.802 align:center
but fairness and cooperation.

00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:27.642 align:center
Ambitious, time-bound commitments

00:06:27.642 --> 00:06:31.322 align:center
to deliver long-term,
low cost financing at scale

00:06:31.362 --> 00:06:35.202 align:center
from countries, banks
and development finance institutions.

00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:41.602 align:center
Two, increased concessional financing,
not reclassified financing,

00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:45.482 align:center
that doesn’t just target
the easily profitable projects,

00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:50.202 align:center
but that is leveraged to drive global
capital to least-electrified communities.

00:06:50.602 --> 00:06:51.802 align:center
And three.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:55.282 align:center
Programs that expand
the access to that finance

00:06:55.322 --> 00:06:58.402 align:center
and initiatives that bolster
local supply chains,

00:06:58.402 --> 00:07:00.962 align:center
generating value, revenues,

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.962 align:center
employment and skills at home.

00:07:04.242 --> 00:07:05.402 align:center
These are the solutions

00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:09.002 align:center
that the international community
must make an urgent priority,

00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:11.562 align:center
even as African countries
do their own homework

00:07:11.602 --> 00:07:13.802 align:center
to improve the local business environment.

00:07:14.362 --> 00:07:19.042 align:center
And this, delivering accessible,
clean energy financing at scale

00:07:19.082 --> 00:07:23.002 align:center
will be a far more productive show
of partnership and trust

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:26.802 align:center
than debating what countries should do
with their available resources.

00:07:28.362 --> 00:07:31.562 align:center
Climate justice
is heavy emitters cooperating

00:07:31.602 --> 00:07:33.402 align:center
to realize clean energy futures

00:07:33.442 --> 00:07:35.482 align:center
for those countries
that have been denied,

00:07:35.482 --> 00:07:38.802 align:center
locked out of their fair share
of a global carbon budget.

00:07:39.402 --> 00:07:41.922 align:center
So today, let's cut past the talk

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:45.762 align:center
and focus on unleashing the avalanche
of a clean-energy future

00:07:45.802 --> 00:07:47.882 align:center
that Africa is ready to deliver.

00:07:47.922 --> 00:07:49.082 align:center
Thank you.

00:07:49.082 --> 00:07:50.762 align:center
(Cheers and applause)
