00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.472 align:center
In 1998, a Maryland school district
removed one of American literature’s

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:19.974 align:center
most acclaimed works
from its curriculum.

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.185 align:center
Parents pushing for the ban
said the book

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.021 align:center
was both “sexually explicit”
and “anti-white.”

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:27.732 align:center
Following an outcry from other
parents and teachers,

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:29.525 align:center
the decision was eventually reversed.

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:32.070 align:center
But this was neither the first
nor the last attack

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.531 align:center
on Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why
The Caged Bird Sings.”

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:39.952 align:center
Few books have been challenged more
often than Angelou's memoir.

00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:42.538 align:center
And while book banning decisions
typically aren’t made

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:44.373 align:center
at the state or national level,

00:00:44.373 --> 00:00:47.752 align:center
most of the schools and libraries
that have banned Angelou’s book

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:49.712 align:center
have given similar reasons.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.674 align:center
Most commonly, they argue that the
memoir’s account of sexual assault

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:57.637 align:center
and the violence of US racism are
inappropriate for young readers.

00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:00.640 align:center
But these concerns miss
the point of Angelou’s story,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.268 align:center
which uses these very themes to explore
the danger of censorship

00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:06.646 align:center
and silence in the lives of young people.

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:11.734 align:center
Published in 1969,
“I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings”

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:17.490 align:center
traces the author’s childhood growing up
poor, Black and female in the southern US.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.661 align:center
Central to the narrative is Angelou’s
experience of being sexually assaulted

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:23.871 align:center
when she was seven and a half years old.

00:01:24.413 --> 00:01:28.334 align:center
Surrounded by adults who consider
the subject too taboo to discuss,

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:30.670 align:center
Angelou decides that she is to blame.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:34.340 align:center
And when she finally identifies
her abuser in court,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.300 align:center
he is killed by vigilantes.

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:39.887 align:center
Angelou believes her voice
is responsible for his death,

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:43.307 align:center
and for six years,
she stops speaking almost entirely.

00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:47.270 align:center
The book chronicles Angelou’s journey
to rediscover her voice,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.356 align:center
all while exploring the pain
and misplaced shame

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:53.359 align:center
that emerges from avoiding
uncomfortable realities.

00:01:54.152 --> 00:01:58.406 align:center
The memoir’s narrative voice expertly
blends her childhood confusion

00:01:58.406 --> 00:02:00.366 align:center
with her adult understanding,

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:04.162 align:center
offering the reader insights Angelou
was deprived of as a child.

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:07.790 align:center
She connects her early experiences
of being silenced and shamed

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.378 align:center
to the experience of being poor and Black
in the segregated United States.

00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:14.964 align:center
“The Black female,” she writes,

00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:19.468 align:center
“is caught in the tripartite crossfire
of masculine prejudice,

00:02:19.927 --> 00:02:23.723 align:center
white illogical hate,
and Black lack of power.”

00:02:24.932 --> 00:02:27.185 align:center
Her autobiography was
one of the first books

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:30.104 align:center
to speak openly about child sexual abuse,

00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:34.692 align:center
and especially groundbreaking to do so
from the perspective of the abused child.

00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:39.113 align:center
For centuries, Black women writers
had been limited by stereotypes

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:41.365 align:center
characterizing them as hypersexual.

00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:43.701 align:center
Afraid of reinforcing these stereotypes,

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:46.913 align:center
few were willing to write
about their sexuality at all.

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:49.624 align:center
But Angelou refused to be constrained.

00:02:49.957 --> 00:02:53.044 align:center
She publicly explored
her most personal experience,

00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:55.254 align:center
without apology or shame.

00:02:55.463 --> 00:02:59.592 align:center
This spirit of defiance charges
her writing with a sense of hope

00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:03.179 align:center
that combats the memoir’s
often traumatic subject matter.

00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:07.516 align:center
When recalling how a fellow student
defied instructions not to sing

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:10.561 align:center
the Black National Anthem
in the presence of white guests,

00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:16.567 align:center
she writes, “The tears that slipped down
many faces were not wiped away in shame.

00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:20.488 align:center
We were on top again... We survived.”

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:26.410 align:center
Angelou’s memoir was published amidst the
Civil Rights and Black Power movements,

00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:29.413 align:center
when activists were calling
for school curricula

00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:33.209 align:center
that reflected the diversity
of experiences in the US.

00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:37.964 align:center
But almost as soon as the book appeared
in schools, it was challenged.

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:44.303 align:center
Campaigns to control lesson plans surged
across America in the 1970s and 80s.

00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:46.931 align:center
On the American Library Association’s list

00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:49.642 align:center
of most frequently banned
or challenged books,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.522 align:center
“I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings”
remained near the top for two decades.

00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:59.318 align:center
But parents, students, and educators
have consistently fought back

00:03:59.318 --> 00:04:01.237 align:center
in support of the memoir.

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:07.326 align:center
And by 2013, it had become
the second most taught non-fiction text

00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:09.704 align:center
in US high school English classes.

00:04:10.913 --> 00:04:16.836 align:center
When asked how she felt about writing one
of the most banned books, Angelou said,

00:04:17.753 --> 00:04:22.008 align:center
“I find that people who want my book
banned have never read

00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:23.926 align:center
a paragraph of my writing,

00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:27.013 align:center
but have heard that I write about a rape.

00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:32.351 align:center
They act as if their children are
not faced with the same threats.

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:33.936 align:center
And that’s terrible.”

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:37.356 align:center
She believed that children who are
old enough to be the victims

00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:41.444 align:center
of sexual abuse and racism are
old enough to read about these subjects.

00:04:41.444 --> 00:04:45.406 align:center
Because listening and learning
are essential to overcoming,

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:50.453 align:center
and the unspeakable is far more
dangerous when left unspoken.
