00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.639 align:center
Smallpox is one of the deadliest
diseases in history,

00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:22.685 align:center
but fortunately, it’s been eradicated
for over 40 years.

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:27.732 align:center
However, samples of the virus
that causes smallpox still exist,

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:31.402 align:center
leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it.

00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:33.321 align:center
This is especially worrying

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:37.158 align:center
because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects,

00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:41.245 align:center
and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease.

00:00:41.662 --> 00:00:43.956 align:center
To protect against this potential threat,

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:47.752 align:center
the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:49.128 align:center
and vaccines.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:53.800 align:center
And since it’s unethical to expose
people to a highly lethal virus,

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:59.972 align:center
labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects.

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:05.978 align:center
But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat?

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.900 align:center
Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments?

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.364 align:center
What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario?

00:01:18.074 --> 00:01:20.576 align:center
In many ways, this dilemma isn't new.

00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:25.331 align:center
Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries,

00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:28.167 align:center
typically at the cost of their lives.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.172 align:center
This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable

00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:34.966 align:center
than non-human lives.

00:01:35.258 --> 00:01:38.845 align:center
People have different views about
the ethics of animal testing

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:40.388 align:center
and how it’s conducted.

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:42.098 align:center
But whatever your opinion,

00:01:42.098 --> 00:01:45.643 align:center
this scenario raises an important
philosophical question:

00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:50.690 align:center
how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human?

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:56.487 align:center
One tool philosophers have used
to consider this question is moral status.

00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:01.033 align:center
Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.871 align:center
taken into consideration by those
making decisions that impact them.

00:02:05.163 --> 00:02:08.708 align:center
Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary—

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:12.837 align:center
either a being’s interests matter
for their own sake, or they don’t.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.842 align:center
And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:19.719 align:center
and other animals didn’t.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.347 align:center
Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan

00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:26.517 align:center
have argued that moral status
comes in degrees,

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:31.564 align:center
but even in this model, he argues
that people have the most moral status.

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:37.028 align:center
However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult.

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:41.616 align:center
Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:45.494 align:center
because of their rational nature
and ability to will their actions.

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:51.292 align:center
A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities

00:02:51.292 --> 00:02:54.754 align:center
are “persons” bearing full moral status,

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.550 align:center
while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status.

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:04.263 align:center
But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard
have argued a Kantian view

00:03:04.263 --> 00:03:09.185 align:center
should include many non-human animals
because of how they value their own good.

00:03:09.852 --> 00:03:13.773 align:center
Another line of argument, suggested
by utilitarianism’s founding father

00:03:13.773 --> 00:03:16.984 align:center
Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer,

00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:19.278 align:center
claims that a capacity for suffering

00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:22.323 align:center
makes an entity worthy
of moral consideration.

00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:27.954 align:center
These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope

00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:30.122 align:center
of our moral responsibility,

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.668 align:center
in ways some people might find unnerving.

00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:36.754 align:center
So where do our monkeys stand?

00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:41.884 align:center
Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities.

00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:44.804 align:center
They live cooperatively
in complex social groups

00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:48.266 align:center
and recognize members
of their community as individuals.

00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:50.935 align:center
They support and learn from one another—

00:03:51.143 --> 00:03:54.188 align:center
there’s even evidence
they respond to inequality.

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:57.692 align:center
And of course,
they’re capable of suffering.

00:03:58.442 --> 00:04:02.321 align:center
Yet despite all this,
it’s still generally common opinion

00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:05.658 align:center
that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s.

00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:10.830 align:center
And that while killing one human
to save five others is typically wrong,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.126 align:center
killing one monkey to save five humans
is regrettable,

00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:17.211 align:center
but morally acceptable.

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:20.131 align:center
Even morally required.

00:04:20.923 --> 00:04:25.177 align:center
At some point, however,
this calculation starts to feel unstable.

00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:29.265 align:center
Should we kill 100 monkeys
to save five people?

00:04:29.432 --> 00:04:31.309 align:center
How about 10,000?

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:35.604 align:center
If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically,

00:04:35.604 --> 00:04:39.859 align:center
any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person.

00:04:40.526 --> 00:04:44.989 align:center
But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all,

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:47.867 align:center
then at some point the balance will tip.

00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:52.788 align:center
The situation you're in complicates
things even further.

00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:54.915 align:center
Unlike the scenarios above,

00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:58.461 align:center
there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives.

00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:01.714 align:center
This is true of any animal experiment—

00:05:02.006 --> 00:05:07.094 align:center
the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care.

00:05:07.553 --> 00:05:09.972 align:center
But in your case,
it’s even trickier!

00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:13.809 align:center
While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized,

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.687 align:center
if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated,

00:05:16.687 --> 00:05:19.815 align:center
and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox.

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:24.153 align:center
You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.698 align:center
But how do you determine what
an acceptable amount of risk is?

00:05:27.907 --> 00:05:31.410 align:center
And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.996 align:center
are essentially wild guesses?

00:05:35.122 --> 00:05:39.460 align:center
These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.463 align:center
and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way

00:05:42.463 --> 00:05:44.173 align:center
to make moral decisions.

00:05:44.673 --> 00:05:49.387 align:center
But whatever you decide,
your choice should be well justified.
